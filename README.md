This is an app that lets Shopify stores integrate NFT collection discounts into their store

It leverages the [Shopify API Library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) on the backend to create [an embedded app](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started#embed-your-app-in-the-shopify-admin), and [Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) and [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/tools/app-bridge/react-components) on the frontend.

This is the repository used when you create a new Node app with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli).
